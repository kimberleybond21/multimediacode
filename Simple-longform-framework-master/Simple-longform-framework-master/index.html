  <h2>The UK’s nightclub industry is dying.</h2>
  <p>The rave culture of the 90's is long gone; the days of Madchester are now far behind us, relegated as a piece of nostalgia in <i>This is England</i> specials. </p>

  <p>Britain, it seems, has gone to bed.</p>

<h3>So why are Britain’s nightclubs closing their doors and giving themselves an early night?</h3>
<p> One argument could be due to the recession, which has taken quite a toll on the country’s spending power. </p>

<p>It might be as simple as the UK’s clubbing culture is not as much as an all-encompassing lifestyle like it used to be. The second summer of love is long over. Yeah, the 90’s may have had the high points of rave and ecstasy, but now we have <i> Geordie Shore's </i> Joel Corry heading to Milton Keynes on Saturday night, so who’s <i> really </i> fucking winning?</p>

  However, whilst many of us despair about the state of the UK’s nightclub industry, one city still has the energy to stay up all night dancing while the rest are getting into their pyjamas. </p>
<p>
Nottingham, the city which reputedly has more bars and nightclubs per square miles than anywhere else in Europe, has a thriving nightlife when compared to the shrinking nightclub industry elsewhere.
 </p>
<figure>
 <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zNeKOjH-rzfQ.kWJFSHgdumPI" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
<figcaption> Nottingham has nearly 100 different clubs, pubs and bars in the city centre alone </figcaption> </figure>
  <p>A case in point: Adam Pereira and Adam Sumner opened Das Kino in 2013, and have expanded their brand to the Hockley Arts Club in October of 2015.</p>
  <figure>
  <img src="img/IMG_9931.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption>The Hockley Arts Club offers some respite from wild nights, pitching cocktails and civilised chat instead </figcaption>
  </figure>
   <p> Now, five months on, both businesses are thriving, with the business partners thinking of expanding once more.</p>
<blockquote class="left">
  ‘What’s good about Nottingham is that it’s a city with a lot of identity.’
</blockquote>
<p>
  Yeah, things are good.’ Adam Pereira tells me as he gives me another whip round tour of the Arts Club. ‘We’ve been more experimental here, trying things and seeing what works.’ </p>
  <p>The Hockley Arts Club is different to the rest of Nottingham’s nightclub scene, offering a more civil outing when compared to other, wilder student nights across the city. </p>
    <p>‘That’s because we believe the face of clubbing is changing.’ Adam Pereira says, as he shows me a list of cocktails on their secret menu. ‘Less people want to go out and get messy; it’s more about going out, having a few nice drinks in a relaxed atmosphere.’
</p><figure>
<img src="img/IMG_9916.jpg" alt="" />
<figcaption>Hockley, Nottingham's answer to Shoreditch, offers an edgy alternative to a mainstream night out </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Maybe the nightclub industry in the UK isn’t dying, but evolving away from going out on a mad one. Perhaps the UK is becoming a country of sophisticates, with after-work drinks in cocktail bars winning out over all-night raves.
</p>
<p>
  Peirera agrees to a point. ‘What’s good about Nottingham is that it’s a city with a lot of identity.’ He says. ‘If you want chart music, there’s Oceana, if you want deep house, there’s Marketbar. There’s something for everyone.’.
</p>
<p> Pereira isn’t wrong. Nottingham is representative of a city with a multiple personality disorder; often resembling a ‘best bits’ compilation tape of the other major cities but in miniature; Hockley mimics Shoreditch, the Victoria Centre is a distant cousin of the Trafford. </p>

  <p> Because there’s a regular influx of students every year, each club in Nottingham has to offer something different to keep the punters coming back.

  Ocean Nightclub, a nightclub popular with both universities, riffs off huge student population, with its unique stamp on the city for being strictly 100% student only; once and for all eliminating that creepy fifty-year-old man in the corner vibe that a lot of nightclubs have going on these days.

</p>
<p> Andy Hoe, the self-proclaimed ‘King of the Ocean’ (making him Nottingham’s answer to Neptune), spoke to me about his venture, which sees many students regularly taking a dip. </p>
<p>
‘I’m very proud of it.’ He says, in his loud Northern drawl. ‘It’s really built up from its humble roots.’

<p>
  I pause, considering a life as a student in Nottingham before Ocean; my twenty-six year old brother still reminisces about nights at Ocean, hell, my thirty-two year old cousin who lives in Italy can still recall the stickiness of the Ocean dancefloor.
  <figure>
  <img src="img/beauts.jpg" alt="" />

  </figure>
</p>
<p> '14 years.’ Andy clarifies, ‘That’s how long I’ve been running the Friday night for UoN students for.’  </p>
<p> Bucking the trend of the closure of nightclubs across the country, Andy tells me that Ocean has actually got busier year on year. ‘This year has been the busiest yet.’ He says. ‘We’re at max capacity every week, even during the exam periods.’ </p>
<p> Whilst some clubs may gain their traffic through their drinks deals and flyers pushed under your flat’s door, Ocean has no promotion at all. In spite of the lack of presence around the city, Ocean manages to, well, keep afloat from what seems to be sheer notoriety alone. </p>
<h2>Taking a dip in the Ocean</h2>
<div class="owl-carousel">
  <div> <img src="img/Slider/oshin.JPG" alt="" /><figure> <figcaption> My night started at 8pm (yes, really) to join the queues for the sell-out night.</fig> </figcaption></div>
  <div> <img src="img/Slider/ocean9.JPG" alt="" /><figcaption> Gemma, Lucy and Jess joined me queueing on the door after tickets for tonight's Ocean sold out two weeks ago.</fig> </figcaption> </div>
  <div> <img src="img/Slider/ocean11lol.JPG" alt="" /><figcaption>This was probably due to the SU elections, which meant there were hopefuls campaigning everywhere</fig> </figcaption> </div>
  <div> <img src="img/Slider/ocean6.JPG" alt="" /><figure><figcaption>...So many cheerful candidates...</figcaption></div>
    <div> <img src="img/Slider/ocean10.JPG" alt="" /><figure><figcaption> Whilst campaigners set up, I made the most of an empty dancefloor</figcaption></div>
<div> <img src="img/Slider/ocean8.JPG" alt="" /><figure><figcaption> I forlornly look at the empty bar, gasping for a shot of sambucca to get me through the DJ's questionable music choices</figcaption></div>
<div> <img src="img/Slider/ocean 3.JPG" alt="" /><figure><figcaption> But I power through, and gallantly lie saying I'm totes #teamterry too </figcaption></div>
  <div> <img src="img/Slider/ocean1.JPG" alt="" /><figure><figcaption> They're happy <i> now </i>, but they haven't felt the crushing weight of a dissertation yet </figcaption></div>
    <div> <img src="img/Slider/ocean 2.JPG" alt="" /><figure><figcaption> At 10:30, Ocean hits max capacity. Well, except one. Ocean <i> is </i> fun, but it's not for the faint-hearted (or the clear headed) </figcaption></div>

</div>
</p>
<p> Ocean’s popularity may also be due to Andy himself – If Ocean nightclub was a person, it would be Andy Hoe. Warm, friendly and no pretences, this is reflected in the club’s music choices, displaying an unapologetic taste for pure, cheddar cheese. </p>
<p> ‘Yeah, we’re a big fan of our pop classics,’ Andy laughs. ‘We play up tempo stuff at peak times, but then we have forty minutes towards the end of the night called the “Erection Section”.’ </p>
<p> This rather nauseating name stems from Andy’s own previous clubbing experiences; the early, better days of clubbing where men and women tended not to bump-n-grind so openly and rather dance separately until near the end of the night, where slower songs were played as an opportunity for men to ask women to dance. In spite of its awful name, it works; The Erection Section playlist has nearly 1000 followers. </p>
  <iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Aandy.hoe%3Aplaylist%3A4p3jefXg6iksPT9Hlr0YHA" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
  <p> ‘The ‘Erection Section’ just allows people to have a singalong. It’s wonderful to see people screaming to Westlife at three am – it might be old-fashioned, but everyone has a good time.’ </p>
  <p> Ocean’s antiquity as a nightclub is also reflected in the layout of the club itself. Instead of the multi-room mega-clubs like the late Gatecrasher of Birmingham, Ocean is an old style dance-hall; one big dancefloor, with a balcony overlooking the madness that takes place below. Andy refuses to change or renovate the club, insisting quite of a lot of the aspects that someone may consider dinge is part of its charm.
    <div id="container1">
  <img src="img/IMG_9886.jpg" alt="">
  <img src="img/oshin.jpg" alt="">
</div>
<p> When asked whether he will extend Ocean’s current two-night run into something open to Nottingham’s general masses, Andy says no without missing a beat. </p>
<p> ‘It works well like this.’ Andy admits. ‘If we had nights five/six times a week for the entire city, then it would lose its appeal to the students; everyone knows each other and has a really great time.’ He laughs. ‘Friday night Ocean is basically a religion to the Nottingham students.’ </p>


</section>
<p> Because so many of us attend Friday service at the Church of Ocean, Andy cannot deny its universal appeal. </p>
<p> ‘I have let the odd mum in before.’ Andy admits. ‘They usually give me a bollocking about how much of their money their kid has spent here.’ He laughs. ‘But they usually have a great time as it takes them back to their youth.’ </p>
<p> So whilst Adam Pereira argues that the face of clubbing has changed, Andy argues otherwise. ‘People still want an end destination on a big night out, but they don’t want the wankiness so many clubs pander too. They want to be somewhere fun. We have no bullshit here with sparklers in champagne bottles or anything like that, we’re all about having a good honest night out.’ </p>
<p> So maybe the nightclub industry in the UK isn’t dying, but rather, certain aspects are being put to bed; people aren’t going to waste a night out at these generic clubs with no individual identity. Nottingham’s nightlife is thriving because the city itself offers more than your Tiger Tigers and Lola Los. Perhaps if the rest of the UK followed Nottingham’s groove, then there would be more of us up at night. </p>
